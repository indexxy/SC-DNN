#### Simple instructions
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Make sure that [dnn](https://github.com/volf52/deep-neural-net/) is present as a subdirectory along with datasets it includes.
   (`cd` into the SC-DNN directory and run `git submodule update` to fetch the latest version of `mlpcode`/`dnn`)


- Examples on testing a dataset using SC-DNN are provided in [example.py](example.py)
